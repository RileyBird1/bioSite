                        Guided Hope strives to mentor children, strengthen families, share hope, and inspire service through ranch activities. We serve children, teens, adults, 
                        and families, whether they have experienced challenging circumstances or simply wish to strengthen their families through shared time and serving on the 
                        ranch. Guests who are touched by grief, military service, foster care, adoption, medical hardships, as well as anyone who wants to reconnect, grow, 
                        laugh, learn, and serve all benefit from our Roundup experience!  We are a ranch filled with God’s amazing creation and the hope we have in Jesus.

                        As a newly married couple in 2000, Guy and Kaarin discussed their dreams.  God had been working on their hearts independently, preparing them for an 
                        opportunity to serve together. Kaarin had been training to be a Therapeutic Riding Instructor.  She had come “off the road” of meeting and events’ travel 
                        and sought an opportunity to help others through animals and country living, while utilizing her event planning and ranch experiences.  Guy’s technical 
                        engineering skills and creative building ideas would come in handy for the new projects God had in store for him.  He had hoped for a place to help people 
                        through loss of a loved one.  Blessed by the incredible support he had received as a young widower and father, he had many ideas on how to provide the same 
                        hope, encouragement and resources for others.  Their dreams led them to an exciting endeavor.
                        Fast forward to 2008.  They had four ranch-hands eager to get started!  Friends and family proposed they inquire about “Crystal Peaks Youth Ranch” and 
                        their annual Training Clinics on “How to Start Your Own Non-profit.”   That June, after time in Oregon being ministered to, educated, and encouraged, 
                        they felt they had their needed tools to move forward.
                        On May 1st, 2012, their dream became a reality with the official incorporation of Guided Hope.   Their families’ shared love of hospitality and service 
                        had always been lived out in their home, but this was an opportunity to care for others in a new way through country living with God’s amazing creatures.  
                        When Guy and Kaarin married, Kaarin had the incredible privilege of adopting Katelyn, which lead them to reaching out to other adoptive families.  Having 
                        had both their fathers as well as Kaarin’s brother and sister-in-law serve in the military, they strongly desired to serve those that served our country.   
                        Several people contacted them in the midst of difficult medical hardships and they recognized a needed opportunity to provide support and hope during these 
                        challenging times.  Others, including foster families, simply desired a time to serve, learn, and play together while making lasting memories.
                        Guy and Kaarin, together with Katelyn, Tucker, Kira, Jessika, and all those that have blessed us with their love, prayers, and support, invite you to come, 
                        enjoy and serve alongside us at Guided Hope!
