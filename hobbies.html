                        Kaarin Scoma is the Executive Director of Guided Hope, whom this website is about.  She prefers simple styles, which is why I made this site more basic.  
                        She loves to work with kids and adults alike and leads her team of volunteers well.  She loves the Lord and her work.  Her hobbies include spending time with 
                        her family, taking care of the animal ambassadors that live on their farm, spending time riding and doing chores with volunteers, riding with her kids, and 
                        serving and loving on guests.  She spends time prayerfully considering next steps for their nonprofit organization.  Truly, she is the heart of the organization,
                        which is why I wanted to do this site about her organization.
